<h2 class="color:var(--titles-color)">Extreme Transparency in Online Betting</h2>
<p>Hey! We are an iGaming affiliate. That means we make money every time a user we refer (send) to a casino places a bet (called Revenue-Share) or when he/she signs up (CPA).</p>
<p><strong class="text-dark">Do you also want to make money online by being an affiliate?</strong> <a href="{{ metadata.author.url }}">Send us a message</a> and I will share with you what I know.</p>
<p>
    There are (too) many <a href="{{ '/casinos/' | locale_url }}">online casinos</a>, too much regulation (of the shi***y kind). So you might feel lost. So... here we are. Betizen, cutting through the BS in online betting, but still being zen about it ðŸ¤£. 
</p>
<p>
    Don't get lost in the glitz. 
</p>
<p>What is a good casino for us? Well, it's not that hard, just one that is transparent about what is offering, the conditions, and that well... PAYS when it has to! One that let's you limit your gambling and earn a buck.</p>
<p>
    What is a good affiliate program? Also simple, one that is not tricky about admin fees, that pay what the program promises and has a good system (with API).
</p>
<p>What is a good game studio / provider? One that creates great, fair audited games that are fun to bet on!</p>

<p>Don't be fooled by flashy facades.</p>
