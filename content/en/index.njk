<p>
    So to clear things out, (and avoid getting lost in the glitz):
</p>
<p>What is a good casino for us? Well, it's not that hard, just one that is transparent about what is offering, the conditions for withdrawing, and that well... PAYS when it has to! One that let's you limit your gambling and earn a buck.</p>
<p>
