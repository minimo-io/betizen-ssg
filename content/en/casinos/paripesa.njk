<h2 id="juegos" class="contentIndexTitle">Games at Paripesa Casino&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">Paripesa is one of those reliable casinos that bets on the breadth of its offering: slots, both classic and modern, sports betting, and live casino.</h3>
<p>Paripesa casino was fundamentally created as a sports betting site complemented by a very important selection of <a href="/juegos/tragamonedas/">slots</a> and live casino games.</p>
<p>The site will immediately remind users of a white-label version of <a href="/en/online-casino/national-casino/">National Casino</a>, albeit with Paripesa's own visual identity. Regarding what concerns us in this particular review—the casino and slots section—Paripesa features 95 slot providers, including some of the industry's most important content creators.</p>
<p><em><strong>→ Remember, you can view the complete list of slot creators in this list of providers.</strong></em></p>
<p>Among them are globally recognized developers such as <a href="/en/game-provider/gamebeat-studio-slots/">Gamebeat</a> and Booongo (creator of hits like the Buddha Fortune slot). Fans of video bingo will also find popular titles from developers like Zitro.</p>
<p><em>→ At Betizen, we feature some of the most popular video bingo games, such as Pachinko 3D by <strong>Playbonds casino</strong> </em><strong><em>or those created for <a href="/en/game-provider/neko-games/">Nako games</a></em> (which perhaps produced the most successful version of the <a href="/juego/tragamonedas-halloween-25-lineas/">Halloween 25 Lines slot</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p>While in this part of the Betizen project we are focusing on games of chance derived from a classic casino—such as slots— it is always interesting for players to include platforms like <strong>Paripesa</strong> on our list of <a href="/en/online-casinos/">reliable casinos</a>. These platforms offer an abundance of options and allow users to try other games and entertainment options, such as sports betting. </p>
<p>In addition to this, Paripesa also offers a <strong>live casino</strong> with a welcome package that, as we will see, can be astonishing (though it is always advisable to read the terms and conditions carefully, see below).</p>
<p>In this live games package, users will find games from industry giants like Pragmatic Play and Evolution. The selection spans from Online Roulette to Online Baccarat and American Blackjack. The offering is broad and comprehensive, which can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming compared to other reliable casinos like <a href="/en/online-casino/megapari/">MegaPari</a> or Playfina.</p>
<p>While it may not be for everyone, Paripesa is nonetheless a platform that, as we will see in the gaming licenses section, is trying to enter the market with good intentions and offering a complete platform to provide users with all the online entertainment they might need.</p>
<h2 id="bonos" class="contentIndexTitle">Promotions and Payments&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">The Paripesa promotion consists, for all users, of up to 150 free spins and a 100% bonus with standard global conditions, applicable to both sports betting and casino play.</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the <strong>Paripesa casino</strong> has a wide offering, yet its main product verticals are sports betting (about which we will have more news on Betizen, stay tuned) and casino games.</p>
<p>Given its global ambitions, Paripesa’s bonus and promotion offering—which is frankly impressive—is standardized for international users.</p>
<p>Here are the details.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Global Welcome Bonus for Sports Betting</h2>
<p>The Paripesa casino bonus for new users consists of 100% up to $1,500 USD.<br>As with all Paripesa welcome bonuses, the bonus value will be credited automatically after the deposit is made.</p>
<p>The minimum deposit is $10 USD.</p>
<p>This is the bonus for sports betting.<br>Below, you can see the bonus for casino play.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Welcome Package for Casino Users</h2>
<p>The welcome package for the casino offered by Paripesa to its users consists of <strong>100% up to</strong> $<strong>1,500 USD + 150 FS</strong> (free spins).</p>
<p>The minimum deposit required to start participating in this package is $10 USD. The free spins are distributed as follows:</p>
<ul><li>For the first and second deposit, spins can be used exclusively on the game <strong>Juicy Fruits 27 Ways</strong> by Barbara Bang.</li><li>For the third and fourth deposit, free spins will be active for the <strong>Coco Tiki slot</strong> by Mancala Gaming.</li></ul>
<p>These are the bonus details for each deposit at Paripesa.</p>
<ul><li>For the 1st deposit &#8211; 100% and 30 FS</li><li>For the 2nd deposit &#8211; 50% and 35 FS</li><li>For the 3rd deposit &#8211; 25% and 40 FS</li><li>For the 4th deposit &#8211; 25% and 45 FS</li></ul>
<p>The rollover, or the number of times the bonus amount must be wagered, is x35 for all users.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Promotion for Casino and Sports Betting (International Users)</h2>
<p>Paripesa recognizes the global appeal of its platform. The casino offers a unified bonus of up to <strong>$1,500 USD + 150 free spins</strong> for all international users.</p>
<p>The conditions regarding the free spin bonus are standardized globally and require them to be played on two specific slots: Juicy Fruits 27 Ways and Coco Tiki. </p>
<p>The <a href="/en/articles/">rollover</a> condition of x35 applies to all users.</p>
<p><strong>Paripesa is among the casinos that accept Astropay.</strong></p>
<h2 id="atencion-al-cliente" class="contentIndexTitle">Customer Service&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">∼ Average</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">Paripesa has a customer service available in the following languages: Hindi, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Vietnamese.</h3>
<p>Paripesa aims to be a global casino; current trends indicate it is trending in emerging markets, with a significant leap starting in November 2021. However, it currently does not offer customer service in every major language.</p>
<p>While the agent's response in our tests was quick, for now, international users will need to communicate in English for support.</p>
<p>We hope that Paripesa will soon expand its local support alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="usabilidad" class="contentIndexTitle">Design and Usability&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">The Paripesa site is pleasant, although it may be confusing for beginner players.</h3>
<p>As with all casinos whose game offering is focused on providing the greatest possible number of alternatives, Paripesa can lead to confusion for some players who are simply looking to find their favorite slot machines. For this reason, although the site's quality is good, it doesn't dazzle and could simplify its casino and slots to facilitate use.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the number of platform filters is very interesting.</p>
<h2 id="licenses" class="contentIndexTitle">Licenses&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">∼ Average</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">Although relaunched in 2021, Paripesa casino, operated by Propus Holding B.V. under license 1668/JAZ, offers users the necessary guarantees to resolve any potential disputes.</h3>
<p>Paripesa is owned by the company <strong>Vezzali Limited</strong>, registered in Cyprus under registration number (reg. number HE 410688) and operated by <strong>Propus Holding B.V.</strong> (reg. number 154511), registered in Curaçao. According to the commercial registry of this country, the latter was incorporated in July 2020, with Alexei Lupanov, a Ukrainian national, as its CEO and the company <strong>RudLuc Directors N.V.</strong> as its local representative.</p>
<p>Again, according to records from the Curaçao Chamber of Commerce obtained via Open Corporates. You can find out more about this at the <a href="  https://opencorporates.com/companies/cw/154511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">following link</a>.</p>
<p>Although the company currently responsible for operating the Paripesa casino has its first registration in 2020, an investigation on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180401000000*/https://paripesa.com/  " target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">archive.org</a> shows that the Paripesa.com site itself was first registered in 2018 through a Facebook app or game, and then primarily launched as a sports betting site in May 2021.</p>
<p>The current license under which Paripesa operates is 1668/JAZ, granted in Curaçao by Curaçao eGaming, one of the official certifiers of that jurisdiction. At the time of writing this review, Paripesa's license is correctly up to date, and interestingly, the license provider (Curaçao eGaming) offers players a form to submit disputes in case they encounter any serious problems while claiming their winnings at the <strong>Paripesa casino</strong>.</p>
<p>This is an interesting advancement for this type of Curaçao license, and the fact that Paripesa is willing to offer its players this type of guarantee allows us to assign a good score to a section that would otherwise have been slightly lower.</p>
<p>We leave below the link to the official certification so you can verify its current status.</p>
