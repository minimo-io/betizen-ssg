<h2 id="juegos" class="contentIndexTitle">Slot games at 21Luckybet&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">We in the face of a casino that offers two different sections, one for slot and table games such as blackjack and another for sports betting, specially important during this Qatar 2022 World Cup</h3>
<p>The 21Luckybet casino is one of those that, while placing special emphasis on its offer of slots and table games, complements its offer in a good way with a sports betting section. Something like what other casinos like LuckyElektra or Somos Casino do.</p>
<p>Regarding its casino lobby, we can find an interesting list of providers and games.</p>
<p>The complete list of them includes games from NekoGames, <a href="/en/game-provider/gamebeat-studio-slots/">Gamebeat</a>, or 1x2Gaming, all prominent providers, although the casino has more than 50 providers in total. Among these online bingo and slot games we can find new releases from Neko Studio like the electronic video bingo Thunderstruck 2, as for Gamebeat (brand new at Betizen) we can highlight games like <a href="/en/game/dangerous-monster-slot/">Dangerous Monster</a> or Buffalo Trail.<br>Please check the complete list of providers below:</p>
<p>1x2Gaming, AlchemyGaming, All41, Anakatech, Aurum, BarCrest, BigTimeGaming, BluePrintGaming, Evolution, BuckStakes Entertaiment, Chance Interactive, Elk, Circular Arrow, CoreGaming, CrazyToothStudio, EyeCon, FortuneFactory, Foxium, GameBurger Studios, Gamevy, Genii, GoldCoin Studios, GongGaming, HackSaw Gaming, HalfPixel Studios, Infinity Dragon Studios, Inspired Gaming, IronDog, Just for the Win, Lightning Box, MicroGaming, NekoGames, Neon Valley Studios, Netent, Nextgen Gaming, NoLimitCity, Nothern Lights Gaming, Old Skool Studios. Pear Fiction, PlaynGo, Pulse 8 Studios, Real Dealer, Red Tiger, Scientific Games, Shuffle Master, Skillzz Games, Skywind, Slingshot, SnowBorn Studios, SpinPlay Games, StormCraft Studios, Switch Studios, Thunderkick, Tom Horn, Triple Edge Studios.</p>
<h2 id="bonos" class="contentIndexTitle">Bonus and promotions&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">The welcome bonus for 21 Luckybet casino is 100% up to $100 + 50 free spins on the Book of Dead slot and the World Cup in Qatar the brand offers various cashbacks.</h3>
<p>Accessing the casino bonuses and promotions in the upper section of 21Luckybet we will find the offer of this bookmaker &amp; free slots to try out. And just as 21Luckybet&#8217;s gaming offer is divided between Casino options and Sports Betting options, so are its promotions.</p>
<p>Regarding its offer of sports betting promotions, we will have specific bonuses per match such as the one for the first match of the first round of the Qatar Cup 2022 between England vs. Qatar with an option of up to $500 in cashback.</p>
<p>It is to be expected that 21Luckybet will have more promotions for the rest of the 2022 World Cup matches.</p>
<p>Then the casino has a great welcome package for those who like slots.<br>The promotion consists of free spins and up to $400 in bonuses on 3 promos for deposit.</p>
<ul><li>The first promotion consists of: 100% up to $100 + 50 free spins on the Book of Dead slot.</li><li>The second deposit promotion is 50% up to $100 + another 50 free spins.</li><li>The third deposit is the most interesting of 100% up to $200 + 50 free spins.</li></ul>
<p>The minimum deposit to participate in these promotions is $20.</p>
<h2 id="atencion-al-cliente" class="contentIndexTitle">Customer support&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">From the beginning of the interaction, 21Luckybet promises us that we will receive support in just a few minutes, something that did not happen in our experience.</h3>
<p>Christos, the affiliate manager of 21Luckybet before Betizen tells us that the casino has native customer service for english speakers. An agent eventually helped us, but we have to wait quite some time, around 20 mintues.</p>
<h2 id="usabilidad" class="contentIndexTitle">Usability&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">∼ Average</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">A new site focused on slots, casino and sports betting and yet it maintains an old-fashioned feel.</h3>
<p>We know that appearance is not everything, but for a site like <strong>21Luckybet</strong> whose focus are slot machines (that is definitely where we are going to see once we first hit the platform) user experience is important, and in the case of this house we cannot stop having the feeling that by 2022 we are facing an outdated site. To confirm this, we only have to see what other platforms dedicated to this segment, such as Somos Casino or the aforementioned LuckyElektra casino, do, with a focus on offering us incredible designs and experiences.</p>
<p>In short, 21Lucky Bet is acceptable but below what is expected in times like the ones we are living, at least in terms of design and usability.</p>
<h2 id="licenses" class="contentIndexTitle">Licenses&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">∼ Average</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">21Luckybet is operated by Muchogaming N.V company under a Curaçao license number 365/JAZ</h3>
<p>The company Muchogaming N.V is a provider of white labels for casinos, one of which is the 21Luckybet casino. The general sub-license used by MuchoGaming products and therefore all its betting sites is GLH-OCCHKTW05012020.</p>
<p>The license is approved at the time of writing this review. Although it is valid to say that as players we must be careful with the licenses granted by the Gaming Curacao provider since according to <a href="https://game-protect.com/curacao-license-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this Game Protect</a> article there is a history that other <a href="/en/online-casinos/">online casinos</a> operating under the same master license have turned out to have practices that are poorly controlled by the provider.</p>
<h2 id="affiliateprogram" class="contentIndexTitle">Affiliate Program&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">The affiliate program for 21Luckybet and other Muchogaminge brands is GamingPoint. The revenue share offer starts at 30%</h3>
<p>As many of our visitors will know at this point, Betizen is making an emphasis on increasing its content offering to cover the affiliate programs of the different casinos and providers in the industry.</p>
<p>In this sense, we intend to tell only our experience in addition to sharing the true numbers of casino affiliate programs from reliable sources such as Affiliate Guard Dog, with the intention of protecting webmasters and future casino affiliates as well.</p>
<p>In this sense, although Gaming Point does not exactly clarify the basic conditions of their affiliate program, at Betizen we did had a great experience with Christos, one of the brand Affiliate managers and he offered us a 30% revenue share.</p>
<p>All affiliates should take into account that these conditions may change from one program or affiliate to another, and according to the agreements between parties, although it would be interesting if the program was more transparent with the starting terms for new affiliates.</p>
<p>The affiliate software used by GamingPoint is the Map platform, map.mediacle.com</p>
