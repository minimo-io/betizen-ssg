<h2 id="juegos" class="contentIndexTitle">Slot games at SlotVibe&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">In a world where sometimes it seems that quantity is what should prevail, SlotVibe offers us a catalog of games that is compact but of extreme quality, in which two games that have paid large sums such as Hit the Gold and Dead or Alive 2 stand out.</h3>
<p>There are many casinos already analyzed at Betizen that dedicate their entire offer to slot games and other single-player table games such as Blackjack, Roulette or Video-Bingo tables. And many of them focus on offering us as many games as possible in their catalogs. Others, as is the case with <strong>SlotVibe</strong>, focus on the quality of their offer, adding only those providers that have a good reputation and of course, those ones with a great slot porfolio.</p>
<p>If we take into account the literally hundreds of providers, the list that SlotVibe will offer us will seem, at least at first glance, somewhat scarce. But let&#8217;s not fool ourselves, because we are dealing with an online casinos, which, as we said, will prioritize quality at all costs.</p>
<p>An it is the case that an online casino that has been launched in 2021 cannot do otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="bonos" class="contentIndexTitle">Bonus and promotions&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">20 free spins WITHOUT THE NEED OF A PRIOR DEPOSIT, is what SlotVibe, unlike other less generous casinos, allows us to offer our users and visitors.</h3>
<p>When the food is very good, a great silence usually reigns at the table. And although this analysis is precisely about telling you the pros and cons of a casino like SlotVibe, that is the feeling that we are presented with in a case like this.</p>
<p>So for the sake of simplicity and without twists: If you want 20 free spins at the time of registration in the casino, all you have to do is add the bonus code or promocode 20BETIZEN in the corresponding box.</p>
<p>This promotion is exclusive to Betizen and we will be promoting it throughout the site in the coming months, so this can be considered a great preview of what&#8217;s to come.</p>
<p>That said, SlotVibe has its own package of promotions. They are not as generous a bonus as the one that is given without the need for a deposit through Betizen but they can still be very interesting.<br>Starting with the promotion of 100% up to 200 euros or 1 BTC + 150 FS (5&#215;30). This being the first deposit promo for the casino.</p>
<h2 id="atencion-al-cliente" class="contentIndexTitle">Customer support&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">∼ Average</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">Much room for improvement regarding customer service for a SlotVibe casino.</h3>
<p></p>
<h2 id="usabilidad" class="contentIndexTitle">Usability&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">∼ Average</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">A nice and correct design, easily accessible both on desktop and on mobile devices, even though lacks the possibility of more specific filtering of games, such as by theme or volatility.</h3>
<p>What we all expect from an online casino focused exclusively slot games, is simplicity. We can see this in casinos with elaborate interfaces like Twin or LeoVegas and also in others with a more outdated design like Royal Panda. And luckily this is the case with SlotVibe.</p>
<p>With a design that does not make us wonder or waste time trying to find the options we are looking for, it gives us an attractive but simple design, with the registration form in the first instance and immediately below, their entire game offer.</p>
<p>These are arranged in categories, and although the filters are somewhat primary and it would be nice to be able to enable options to carry out more specific searches, we can see the new games, the top or featured ones, the slots, those games with jackpots, those available to bet with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and live table games.</p>
<p>In our opinion it would be nice to be able to find a category that would group all table games that are not live. Additionally, we can find the games by name or by provider.</p>
<p>As we said, filters that are too basic and barely enough, but at least they are easy to use both on our desktop computer and on mobile devices, to find the more than 3,500 available on the site.</p>
<p>And when we put a score, we do it because at Betizen we know that it is possible to do better, in fact we have made an effort ourselves, without being a casino but an affiliate analysis site to offer, for example, volatility filters, prizes or RTP to that nobody has problems in finding the slots and games that best suit their pocket and needs.</p>
<h2 id="licenses" class="contentIndexTitle">Licenses&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">∼ Average</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">Let&#8217;s be clear, SlotVibe operates under a poor license shared by disreputable casinos. That being said, it seems to be the exception that proves the rule, trying to do things right.</h3>
<p>SlotVibe uses what is quite frankly one of the worst licenses in Curaçao, the 8048/JAZ. We have commented on this license by reviewing other casinos like Loki or Golden Star, just to name a few and the results have been poor. Why? Well, because the 8048/JAZ license is shared by casinos with a very bad historical reputation, and the fact of being in that group, (operated by DAMA N.V, the same company in charge of operating Loki, Golden Star, Betchain, or Joo Casino) it is not too auspicious.</p>
<p>That said we have also repeated on countless occasions that this fact it not a condemnation. International licenses try to protect players, to be an intermediary in the resolution of conflicts, an arbitrator, an entity that inspires trust and that is what this license does not grant. The rest will depend on the casino, which may be actually fair and willing to do things the right way.</p>
<p>In a casino as new as SlotVibe we will know that over time. </p>
<p>As extra details, SlotVibe is operated as we said by <strong>DAMA N.V</strong>, a company incorporated in Curazao under number 152125 and with address at Julianaplein 36, Willemstad, Curaçao. Strukin Ltd. Although friends, these addresses are not to be trusted since there are services that include them in the package sold to the casino owners. Specifically, Slotvibe operates under the sub-license 8048/JAZ2020-013.</p>
<p>Additionally, DAMA N.V was incorporated in 2019, and uses another company as statutory director. The Allyant Group B.V which was also incorporated in 2019 under number 151273. Regarding its headquarters, coincidentally, at the same address as the parent company, Julianaplein 36, Willemstad, Curaçao.</p>
<p>In turn, Allyant Group&#8217;s statutory director is Nathaniëla Margarita Victoria Maria Kwidama, born in 1986 in Willemstad, Curazao. All according to the public records of the Curaçao Chamber of Commerce.</p>
