<h2 class="contentIndexTitle">Is National Casino reliable?</h2>

<p>
    Recently, we shared an analysis of <a href="/en/online-casino/coins-game/" title="CoinsGame">CoinsGame</a> for all Betizen visitors, one of those online casinos we can trust, both as players and affiliates (and here we're talking about transparency).</p>
<p>
    In that case, it was for the LATAM audience, but now we continue with this intention of providing quality analysis for the European public. To do so, we bring to the table <strong>National Casino</strong>, with a specific focus on the European gambling audience (especially catering to Spain and Germany, which is common for casinos of European origin, and we'll analyze it in detail in the corresponding reviews).
</p>
<p>
    So without further delay, let's move on to the different sections into which we've divided the analysis of this betting house: Games, Promotions and Payments, Customer Service, Usability, and Licenses.
</p>

<p>If you'd like to discover casinos that don't keep their promisesâ€”whether licensed in Brazil or notâ€”you can take a look at our <a href="/en/online-casinos/blacklisted/">blacklist</a> (in the future, this list will be built based on karma votes from Betizen users), adding the layer of transparency that is at the core of the project's mission.</p>

<h2 class="contentIndexTitle">ðŸ¤‘ How to Withdraw Money from National Casino in Europe</h2>

<p>Withdrawing your winnings from National Casino in Europe is generally a straightforward process, although it may vary slightly depending on the payment methods available at the time and the specific policies of the casino.</p>

<p><strong>General steps:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Log in to your account: Access your National Casino account using your login credentials.</li>
<li>Go to the "Cashier" or "Banking" section: Look for the section of your account where deposits and withdrawals are managed. This is usually clearly identified.</li>
<li>Select the "Withdraw" option: Click on the button or link that indicates "Withdraw funds" or similar.</li>
<li>Choose the payment method: National Casino usually offers a variety of payment methods for withdrawals, such as credit/debit cards, e-wallets (Skrill, Neteller), bank transfers, etc. Select your preferred method.</li>
<li>Enter the amount to withdraw: Indicate the amount of money you wish to withdraw. Make sure you comply with the minimum and maximum limits set by the casino.</li>
<li>Confirm the transaction: Carefully review all the details of your withdrawal request and confirm the transaction.</li>
<li>Wait for processing: The time it takes to process a withdrawal may vary depending on the chosen payment method. E-wallets are usually the fastest, while bank transfers may take longer.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Important considerations:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Identity verification: Before making your first withdrawal, National Casino will likely ask you to verify your identity. This usually involves sending copies of documents such as your official ID and proof of address.</li>
<li>Wagering requirements: Some bonuses and promotions may have wagering requirements that you must meet before you can withdraw your winnings. Make sure to read the terms and conditions of each offer.</li>
<li>Fees: Some payment methods may incur fees from the casino or the financial institution. Check the applicable fees before making your withdrawal.</li>
<li>Security: Always make sure you are connected to the official National Casino website and that the connection is secure (https). Avoid sharing your personal or financial data with third parties.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="juegos" class="contentIndexTitle">Games at National Casino <span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">âœ“ Good</span></h2>
<h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">National is a casino focused on slots and table games for the European market, with 92 providers and abundant gaming options.</h3>

<p><strong>Allows play without registration.</strong></p>

<p>As those who follow Betizen reviews will know, there are casinos focused on what are called several "verticals" in the sector and those focused or specialized in one of them. For example, casinos like 20Bet from Playamo specialize in offering sports betting in addition to free and paid slot games, the so-called "sportsbooks". Others like Trillonario focus on offering us bets on the best lotteries in the world, and others like Vera&John or Royal Panda (fallen from grace), just to name a few, are houses whose main characteristic is to offer you the best of the gaming world, be it slots, online bingo, blackjack and table games in general.</p>

<p>This is the case with National Casino.</p>

<p>A special feature of this type of casino is that we will not only have a more careful selection of slots and games but also the promotions will be specific and more abundant, usually focused on slots (see promotions section below to learn more details about the bonuses of this casino).</p>

<p>So, National Casino offers us slots and games from more than 90 providers or game creation studios. In this list, we will be able to find some of the best and most outstanding providers, such as those that at Betizen, due to their quality and transparency, we have decided to mark as reliable. This is the case of providers such as ELK, Just for the Win, Nolimit City, Thunderkick, or Yggdrasil. The latter created the famous Multifly slot with a maximum win that will allow us to multiply our bet more than x10,000 times.</p>

<p>Other relevant providers that we will find at National Casino are Play'n GO, Wazdan, Platipus, or Playtech, just to name a few. In reality, we are looking at a very complete casino with abundant gaming options.</p>

<p>Another outstanding feature of the casino in question is that National, unlike other casinos with poor respect for users like Spin, allows us to try all games for free before handing over our personal data.</p>

<p>While the impossibility of doing this is often related to the demanding licenses under which some casinos operate, it does guarantee that we can try the platform before risking offering our data and starting to receive news and promotions about the casino.</p>

<p>The way to find and filter the games and slots offered by National is traditional, without very specific forms but sufficient in the desktop version. These game categories are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Game Lobby: In this section, we will have access to a general summary of the best games on offer.</li>
<li>New: Recent launches.</li>
<li>Popular: Those slots and slot machines most played by casino users.</li>
<li>Slots: I don't know if it's really necessary to explain this category, but it's the main one of the casino, here we will access most of the games in the casino's incredible catalogue.</li>
<li>Bonus Buy: Here we will have a list of those games in which we will be able to access the bonus screens without the need to wait for our luck, but with the help of our wallet.</li>
<li>Drops & Wins: In this type of game, we will have special prizes and jackpots not only associated with traditional spins, but for example in the case of the Buddha Fortune slot, to the game's own symbols.</li>
<li>Quick Games: These are those game options that allow us to bet quickly, many will associate this category with classic scratch cards but it also includes games like Bomb Squad from Evoplay.</li>
<li>Blackjack: Well, the classic table games, perhaps along with roulette and video-bingo in countries like Spain, one of the most popular game categories after slot machines.</li>
<li>Roulette: Another especially popular category in Europe, where bettors have a special preference for table games in general.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>At the time of writing this review, user Paul had won â‚¬62,539.09 playing the 9 Happy Pharaohs slot machine.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="bonos" class="contentIndexTitle">Promotions and payments <span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">âœ“ Good</span></h2>
<h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">National Casino offers us a welcome package and multiple promotions focused on slot machines. On your first deposit up to 100% + 100 free spins, with a minimum deposit of â‚¬20, and a rollover of x40.</h3>

<p>As we mentioned in the upper section, the different characteristics of casinos like National specialized in games and slots compared to other casinos with a wider offer, is that in addition to the best quality of the offer itself we will have a series of promotions with special focus on this type of betting. This is the case, of course, with National Casino.</p>

<p>Let's review their promotion offer.</p>

<p>In particular, National Casino offers us what is called in the online gaming sector, a welcome package. In general, these packages reward consecutive deposits and usually have three different promotions for the first 3 deposits. However, in this betting house, we have a package that will reward our first two deposits with the values shown below for Europe.</p>

<ul>
<li>First deposit bonus: 100% up to â‚¬100 + 100 free spins on the Avalon: The Lost Kingdom slot. The first 50 spins will be credited immediately upon confirmation of the deposit and the remaining ones will be credited within 24 hours afterwards.</li>
<li>Second deposit bonus: This bonus, as usual, will offer us half the bonus of the first one, specifically 50% of its value up to â‚¬200. But this bonus comes with 50 free spins on the Johnny Cash slot machine that will be credited instantly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The minimum deposit for the first case is â‚¬20, the rollover amounts to x40. And the maximum bet with the active bonus is â‚¬5.</p>

<p>But in addition to this, National, honoring its specialization, offers other bonuses focused on slot machines. Let's see some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Friday reload bonus: This Friday promotion involves the promo code INLOVE. We will also need a minimum deposit of â‚¬20 to get 50% up to the enormous amount of â‚¬250, as well as 100 free spins to be played on the Book of Cats slot from BGAMING.</li>
<li>Monday free spins: Using the promo code SPINME on Mondays, we will get 100 free spins for the Journey Flirt slot also from BGaming.</li>
</ul>

<p>National Casino's offers and promotions don't end there as they are complemented with promotions for table games, tournaments, and a VIP program in which depending on our level of play we will be getting more and more rewards in the casino from free spins to cash rewards!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Payments at National Casino</h3>

<p>At Betizen, we have always promoted those casinos that are transparent regarding their payment methods prior to registration. This allows us to know if, in addition to the game offer, the forms of payment and withdrawal of prizes adapt to our possibilities.</p>

<p>This is usually a cumbersome issue in the online gaming world and National Casino could do a better job in this regard as we have not found a clear and simple list of the different payment and withdrawal methods it offers and the payment processing times and costs to which we will be subjected once we try to bet for real money at National Casino.</p>

<h2 id="atencion-al-cliente" class="contentIndexTitle">Customer Service <span class="badge badge-danger badge-pill font-weight-bold">- Bad</span></h2>
<h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">As expected, National Casino agents do not speak fluent English or other European languages but use Google Translator. Although the initial response is quick, the complete response never reached us.</h3>

<p>Customer service is a key point for a good gaming experience and an Achilles' heel in most casinos of European origin that have serious intentions to offer themselves in the European market.</p>

<p>Usually, we tend to find slow and poor attention, from some agent in a call center barely familiar with the fact that the casino in question accepts players from various European countries. This has been our experience as online players and therefore we have designed a specific section in which we try to use the customer service of the casino in question to then tell you a summary of our experience.</p>

<p>In this betting house, we will have two options to access this service. In either case, the window that will open is the same, both from the contact button of the main menu on the left or the floating button with the chat symbol in the lower right corner.</p>

<p>From the beginning, the message that will be presented inviting us to leave our name and email is in English. A simple configuration that could definitely be improved and that already indicates that we will hardly find an agent who understands native European languages.</p>

<p>As expected, the agent did not speak fluent English or other European languages but prepared to verify our query using Google Translator. He started the chat after our initial query with a minimum wait of less than a minute. But unfortunately, the complete answer to our question never arrived as the chat closed automatically due to the long delay and waiting time.</p>

<h2 id="usabilidad" class="contentIndexTitle">Design and usability <span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">âœ“ Good</span></h2>
<h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">A clean and simple interface as European online casinos have accustomed us to.</h3>

<p>If customer service is key to a good real money gaming experience where inevitably sooner or later we will be faced with small problems for which we will need assistance, design and usability can also be a key factor that determines whether the experience in a casino is simple and entertaining or confusing and annoying.</p>

<p>Little-known casinos like Gunsbet take this type of experience to another level. Or even Twin offering us just what is necessary but with extreme quality. In this sense, National offers us a very good gaming experience. The sections are reduced to their minimum expression, with a menu that will give us access to Games and Promotions and Tournaments initially, which make up the main attractions of any casino of games and slots. Another menu located on the PC site on the left where it expands the main items with Live Dealers, Aviator, the casino's Hall of Fame, and access to the VIP program.</p>

<p>The design is strongly based on warm colors, driven by very high-quality thematic images in each of its sections. Without a doubt, a casino where the design team is top-notch, as is usually the case with European casinos where competition is fierce and drives product quality.</p>

<p>In the interface for mobile devices, we will have a good quality lower menu and also a good user experience. Unfortunately in this more reduced version, we will not have the possibility to try the slot machines without registration.</p>

<h2 id="licenses" class="contentIndexTitle">Licenses <span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">âˆ¼ Medium</span></h2>
<h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">Having the same license origin as its sister casino 22Bet, National operates under the same Curacao license No. 8048/JAZ, of dubious quality.</h3>

<p>National Casino belongs to the enormous offspring of online casinos with Curacao licenses. Let's say it clearly in case some distracted person has not yet read it, they are not the safest licenses in the online world. And this as we always say does not mean that a casino is not reliable, but it definitely means that as players we will be in the hands of the good or bad intentions of the casino in question.</p>

<p>Curacao licenses differ in quality depending on which is the company that owns the master license that sub-licenses. In the case of National Casino, which is also a sister of another casino such as 22Bet and like this one uses for its operation the dubious license No. 8048/JAZ granted by Antillephone.</p>

<p>The specific operation of this casino is carried out by the company TechSolutions Group N.V. incorporated under number 144920 and which has Aleksandr Bocharnikov as director and another Curacao company RudLuc Directors N.V. as local representative of the shares.</p>
