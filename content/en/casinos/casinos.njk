    While other sites define their ranking according to how much they pay the casinos for appearing in their listings, the Betizen community creates them based on fair data and users votes. Vote and contribute with your opinion!
</p>
<p>
    As we commented on our official presentation page on Betizen and unlike other review sites and affiliates, we do not decide the positions of the casinos in our rankings according to the money offer that we are making, in exchange these positions are decided by the community itself. Why?
</p>
<p>
    At Betizen we think that the world of online betting & gambling should improve its transparency. That there is a need for better informed, reliable casinos players and more transparent slot providers. That we should encourage affiliates who work with the mission of delivering value to players and not with the intention of making money regardless of their health.
</p>
<p>
    At Betizen the priority is to offer you casino reviews that aim to find safe, fair and at the same time fun ways to gamble, minimizing unnecessary risks. And at the same time that they are equally fair for casinos that do things well. To achieve this we have designed a process by which we verify the same things for all bookmakers.
