<h2 id="juegos" class="contentIndexTitle">Games at 88goals casino&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">88goals, lanzado en el 2020 cuenta con una amplia gama de proveedores, de hecho mas de 30 creadores de tragamonedas, casino en vivo, blackjack, e-sports y apuestas deportivas</h3>
<p>88goals, launched in 2020, has a wide range of providers, in fact more than 30 slots creators, live casino, blackjack, e-sports and sports betting.</p>
<p>The full list of 88goals providers includes:</p>
<p>Apollo games, Aspect gaming, August gaming, Betconstruct, BetGames, BetSolutions, Blueprint, Booming games, Booongo, Creedroomz, CQ9, DLV, EBET, Edge gaming, Evoplay, Fazi, Fashion tv, FLG, Fugaso, GameArt, Genesis, Genii, Habanero, Hacksaw, JDB, KaGaming, Kalamba, Kiron, Leap casino, Leap gaming, Leap virtual, Lucky streak, Mrslotty, Multislot, Nolimitcity, Onetouch, Omi gaming, Patagonia, PlayStart gaming, Playson, Pragmatic play, Realistic games, Relax gaming, Revolver gaming, SA gaming, Spadegaming, Spigo, Spinmatic, Spinomenal, Stakelogic, Thunderkick, TomHorn, TVBet, Vela gaming, Vivo gaming, Wazdan, WorldMatch, Xpg, Zeus play.</p>
<p>Many of which are among those present in the Betizen catalogue. Including the electronic video bingos from Salsa Technology or (we think) <a href="/en/game/thunderstruck-ii-online-bingo/">Thunderstruck 2 video bingo from Neko Games</a>, provider of which we will bring more news shortly. Do you know them?</p>
<h2 id="bonos" class="contentIndexTitle">Bonus and promotions&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">∼ Average</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">Although 88goals is a casino that has to improve its local translations, according to Valerie, the brand&#8217;s affiliate manager, this bookmaker has a focus in LATAM, India, Canada and New Zealand to name a few.</h3>
<p>Regarding their welcome promotions or first deposit promos, we have a modest bonus of 50% up to $100, which, probably due to a design flaw, is not visible in the promotions section of the site, at least on some languages.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s remember that 88goals is a new casino and that, like any new project, some non-critical design flaws can be expected. Let&#8217;s give it time and let the feedback over time on Betizen and other user protection sites define its true value.</p>
<h2 id="atencion-al-cliente" class="contentIndexTitle">Customer support&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">∼ Average</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">88goals does not offer customer service in local languages, neither for Spanish America nor for Brazil and contains several translation errors when trying to search for help. </h3>
<p>Although the jurisdictions in which 88goals operates include Latin America, India, Canada and New Zealand to name a few, this casino does not yet have the necessary infrastructure to offer customer service in our local languages, nor the interface is always correctly translated.</p>
<p>Just for information, the countries where 88goals is blocked are:</p>
<p>Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, France, Curaçao, Denmark, Greece, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.</p>
<h2 id="usabilidad" class="contentIndexTitle">Usability&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">∼ Average</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">A low design quality for these times but with good support for mobile devices.</h3>
<p>The design of 88goals, as well as other casinos in our catalog, is not one of the bests, however it is enough, I understand that the bookmaker has a good adaptation to mobile devices from which we can access its wide range of games , entertainment and gambling.</p>
<p>As a major flaw, we must highlight its poor localization.</p>
<h2 id="licenses" class="contentIndexTitle">Licenses&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">∼ Average</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">88Goals uses a Curaçao license, which is active at the time of writing this review.</h3>
<p>The 88goals casino license belongs to the jurisdiction of Curaçao, and its current status can be found at <a href="https://verification.curacao-egaming.com/validateview.aspx?domain=88goals.com">the following link</a>, granted by one of the island&#8217;s license providers such as Curaçao EGaming.</p>
<p>Complaints can be directed to <strong>[email&#160;protected]</strong> although as players it does not make much sense to file a complaint with the entity with which we have a dispute, so we recommend resolving complaints and payment disputes with the same license provider, via the link above.</p>
<p>The license number by which 88goals.com is governed is number 1668 JAZ.</p>
