<p>Few <a href="/en/providers/">providers</a> venture to use board game themes like the popular Monopoly, one of them being the Australians from Big Time Gaming with their slot Monopoly Megaways and its 117,649 possible combinations, successfully launched in 2019, which still has a good legion of followers. Mr. Monopoly will accompany us on the path to real estate success in a 6-reel cascading type game, high volatility, 96.50 RTP, and exciting features and bonuses with which we could win up to 14,700x our bets.</p>
<h2 id="premios" class="contentIndexTitle mb-1">Prizes, RTP, and Volatility&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">117,649 winning combinations, 96.50% RTP, and the possibility of multiplying your bets by 14,700 times are some reasons to play Monopoly Megaways™.</h3>
<p>A video slot with Megaways pay combinations guarantees a high possibility of winning combinations, and in this case, BTG adds a cascading feature to its 6 reels, which will displace the symbols of a winning combination and replace them with new symbols during the same spin, with the possibility of getting more combinations. But that’s not all, as we also have WILD wilds, scatters for free spin bonuses, multipliers, reel adventures, and 117,649 ways to win with a maximum exposure of 14,700x.</p>
<p>BTG has already given us generous and entertaining high volatility and return to player games like Bonanza Megaways™ and Extra Chilli Megaways™, offering with the Monopoly Megaways slot an RTP of 96.5% and maintaining a high variance rating. The betting range also shows that it is a game accessible to all pockets, with minimum bets of USD $0.10 and maximum bets of USD $40.</p>
<p>The symbols included in Monopoly Megaways are represented by 6 lower value symbols like 9, 10, J, Q, K, A. The higher value symbols are the popular game pieces: the dog, the car, the ship, and the hat. The golden M symbol will represent the WILD wild and can substitute all symbols and complete a winning combination during the same spin, appearing only on reels 2 and 6.</p>
<h2 id="funciones-y-mecanica" class="contentIndexTitle mb-1">Features and Mechanics&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">Cascading symbols, wilds, multipliers, and the MAX card that will activate the 117,649 winning lines accompany Mr. Monopoly in his task of buying more properties.</h3>
<p>The Monopoly Megaways slot features the Reactions function, which allows the symbols that form a winning combination to be replaced in cascade mode by new symbols during the same spin. Winning combinations are made up of adjacent symbols from left to right, requiring at least 3 identical symbols, except for the hat which will require only 2 symbols.</p>
<p>The reel adventures mini-game represented by the Monopoly game board squares is located at the bottom of the reels, remaining active during the base game. Mr. Monopoly will move on the squares each time we get a win. If he lands on the <strong>GO</strong> square, the MAX card will be activated, which will trigger the MAX MEGAWAYS™ with its possible 117,649 ways to win.</p>
<p>If Mr. Monopoly lands on a TRAIN STATION square, it will become ours and obtaining the next one will activate an additional free spin. If we land on the UTILITY (LIGHT COMPANY or WATER SERVICE) square for the first time, it will become our property, and the second will activate a win multiplier.</p>
<p>If we move to the COMMUNITY CHEST square, we will receive a card that will send us to a random property, and we could also receive between 1 to 4 houses assigned to the property to which we were sent. CHANCE will send us to a random property and give us a spin with MAX MEGAWAYS. We can also win between 1 to 4 houses assigned to the property to which we were sent. If we reach a square after our third REACTION win, an additional house will be awarded, and each extra will also receive an additional house.</p>
<p>The free spins bonus will be activated when 5 houses are completed on a property, and the bonus will also be awarded if obtained through a CHANCE card. We will be awarded a total of 8 free spins, receiving an extra free spin if we get an additional house after the fifth one on the property, just like additional TRAIN STATIONS. When free spins are activated, we will start with a 1x multiplier, increasing by one for each UTILITY property we own. At the end of the bonus round, we will lose ownership of the TRAIN STATIONS and UTILITY properties, but the houses on properties we did not reach will remain.</p>
