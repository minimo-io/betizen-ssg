title: "Pharaoh&#8217;s Fortune"
description: "The Pharaoh's Fortune slot machine is one of those Egyptian games popular and simple from the international brand IGT, although its technology (flash) in which it was developed puts it at risk of being forgotten unless the developer updates it. Pharaoh's Fortune is one of those classics that you will find in most casinos in the world, one of those with thousands of replicas and copies that never stop being played due to more innovations in the sector. Besides that, little more to say about a slot machine that has stood the test of time in terms of features, with a reasonable RTP although slightly below the industry average, with medium variance or volatility. With fixed payment lines that vary between 15 and 20 depending on whether we are within the bonus or not. In short, a game that stands the test of time, a must-have, worth trying even for nostalgia. As with all IGT slots it may not be available in all countries, so if you are having trouble playing it please report it in the comments."

<p>Pharaoh&#8217;s Fortune is a classic online slot game that has been around since 2006 and offers a simple and well-balanced gameplay experience. With a medium volatility and an RTP of 94.78%, the game features 15 fixed paylines and a traditional 5&#215;3 reel layout. Despite its lower RTP, Pharaoh&#8217;s Fortune is known for its generous payouts, especially during the free spins bonus round.</p>
<p><strong>Playing this free slot it is hard not to remember the recently launched <a href="/juego/amazing-pharaohs-by-nako-games/">Amazing Pharaoh’s</a> by <a href="/game-provider/neko-games/">Neko Games</a>, for sure, an upgraded experience.</strong></p>
<p>The game includes a wild symbol that substitutes for all symbols except for the bonus and scatter symbols. The scatter symbols pay in any position on the reels, and landing three pharaoh symbols on one of the 15 paylines triggers the free spins bonus round. The bonus round starts with just 3 free spins and a x1 multiplier, but can be re-triggered with additional pharaoh symbols, up to a maximum of 25 free spins and a x6 multiplier.</p>
<p>Although the game&#8217;s visual design may be a bit dated, it still features acceptable symbols and animations that are entertaining and engaging. The music adds an extra layer of excitement during gameplay, and the game&#8217;s lack of customization options is a minor drawback.</p>
<p>Overall, Pharaoh&#8217;s Fortune may not have the highest RTP in the industry, but its medium volatility and exciting free spins bonus round make it a fun and rewarding online slot game for players of all levels. With the potential for generous payouts and a simple yet engaging gameplay experience, Pharaoh&#8217;s Fortune is definitely worth a spin.</p>
<p>So, summarizing, Pharaoh&#8217;s Fortune, also known as La Fortuna del Faraón, is a popular and simple Egyptian-themed slot game developed by the international brand IGT. Despite being developed in flash technology, which puts it at risk of being forgotten, it remains a classic that can be found in most casinos worldwide and continues to be played despite industry innovations. The game features fixed paylines that vary between 15 and 20, depending on whether players are within the bonus round or not, with a reasonable RTP and medium volatility. While it may not be available in all countries, Pharaoh&#8217;s Fortune is definitely worth trying for its nostalgic value and timeless appeal.</p>
