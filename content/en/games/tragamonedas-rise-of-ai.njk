<p>The Rise of AI or Rise of Artificial Intelligence slot machine has a traditional 5×3 reel layout, 10 configurable paylines, and a maximum prize that will allow us to multiply our bet up to x500 times.</p>
<p>The RTP of the slot machine is 96%, a reasonable value that falls within the average of slots. The minimum bet is $0.01 if we play with a denomination of 0.01 and on a single payline. The maximum bet on your part is $100, playing with a coin denomination of 1 and all 10 paylines active.</p>
<p>Regarding prizes, perhaps the most interesting aspect of the game are its random multipliers, which can multiply the prizes from each of our winning rounds by up to x50. Let's examine the details in the next section.</p>

<p>The central feature of the Rise of AI slot machine is its random multipliers. They are activated with very good frequency and can allow us to multiply any winning round by up to x50 times.</p>
<p>We are facing a simple game, perhaps too simple in terms of features (although it is succulent in its environment and sophisticated designs), which is also loaded with a mini-gambling game with a base RTP of 84% that can go up to 100% depending on the card dealt, and in which we can double the winnings from our rounds up to 10 times.</p>
<p>This works by choosing a card among 4. If we beat the card provided, our winnings will be doubled, and we can attempt to double the prize again. A functionality we have already seen in games like <a href="/en/game/pharaohs-fortune-slot/">Pharaoh’s Fortune</a> among others, in casinos like <a href="/en/online-casino/ohmyzino/">OhMyZino</a>, and which undoubtedly adds an interesting option for us.</p>
<h2 id="tematica" class="contentIndexTitle mb-1">Theme and design&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">&#10003; Good</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle"></h3>
<p>This is definitely the strong point of the Rise of AI slot machine. For players who enjoy the futuristic theme, this is a slot machine that reminds us of the movie <a href="  https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner  ">Blade Runner</a>. Set in the year 2050, after a global pandemic like the one we are experiencing with Covid-19, the world we knew has ended and is now under the control of an artificial intelligence that, to keep society afloat, occasionally gives out random cash prizes. Hence its random multipliers.</p>
<p>A slot machine that reminds us of what is possible to achieve with the latest technology to deliver engaging entertainment, deliciously crafted, especially in the musical aspect.</p>
<p>For fans of the theme, a must-stop. For those who decide to bet a few coins, a mediocre but interesting game.</p>
