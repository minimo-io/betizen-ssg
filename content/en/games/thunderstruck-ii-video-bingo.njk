<p>We can say that Microgaming&#8217;s <strong>Thunderstruck 2 free slot</strong> is perhaps one of the most popular slot game on the Internet? And that it was about time someone like the brand-new creator of online bingo games <strong>Neko Games</strong> brought some of that magic to online bingo lovers, so that casinos online would no longer refer back and back again to cuddly kittens and we could finally surround ourselves as players, with the glory of the gods? So on that spirit, let&#8217;s give a warm welcome to Thunderstruck II online bingo.</p>
<p>Launched just a few hours ago, there are few details available to us about this new version of a timeless classic (beyond its RTP of 95.13% and a max win or maximum multiplier of x3095) that will surely lead <a href="/en/game-provider/neko-games/">Neko Games</a> to a next level once again by Microgaming (Neko, an online bingo creation studio with offices in Argentina) had already launched another video bingo version of a classic like the Immortal Romance slot.</p>
<p>Welcome the new Thunderstruck 2 online bingo to the Betizen catalog and we hope that as the hours continue we can report some of the most important features of this online bingo beyond its RTP or max exposition.</p>
