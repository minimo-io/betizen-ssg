    The 1x2Gaming European 3D Roulette has as its central characteristic
    regarding prizes and in addition to its usual RTP of 97.30%, which will
    return half of the bet if zero (0) is drawn, increasing its RTP to 98.65%.
</h3>
<p>
    The popularity of
    <a href="/en/jogos/roleta/">Web Roulette</a> among Portuguese-speaking
    players at Betizen is undeniably significant. They represent a large part of
    our audience, and as we are always here to serve them, in this next free
    game from the 1Ã—2 Gaming supplier that we want to share with you, we could
    not choose another online roulette game, in this case, the European 3D
    Roulette from 1x2Gaming, officially the European Roulette.
</p>
<p>
    There are already 8, at the time of writing this review, roulette games that
    we have in the catalog, with the
    <a href="/en/game/roulette-of-gems/">Roulette of Gems</a>
    being the latest major innovation that also earned its place among the
    recommended games.<br />As it is known, each provider tries to have its own
    version of European roulette in its catalog, just as it happens with
    <a href="/en/game/slots-cleopatra/">Cleopatra slot machines</a>
    or Egypt. So, we come to this point, each provider trying to differentiate
    itself in something from the previous one.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of roulette games where depending on whether it is American,
    French, or European roulette, the details of money return to the player and
    others are given by the characteristics of the game itself, and therefore
    the chances of winning generally do not vary much (nor should they) from one
    game to another.<br />And that's why roulette game creators tend to better
    differentiate themselves at the level of the graphical environment of the
    games, in their presentation and betting functions.
</p>
<p>
    In the section referring strictly to the RTP or percentage of return of
    money from the 1x2Gaming European 3D Roulette, we are faced with an official
    value of 97.30%, which according to some other
    <a href="/affiliate-programs/">casino partners</a>, can rise, still without
    being able to fully explain how, up to a maximum of 98.65% (this, as already
    mentioned, we must take it with a grain of salt, as it is not consistent
    with what is an RTP of a traditional European roulette and hence the extra
    characteristic of this European roulette, its return that we will see
    below).
</p>
<p>
    Remember that European Roulette includes all those roulette games that, like
    French roulette, have a betting number range from 0 to 36 (among other
    characteristics). This, as exposed, includes a single zero, unlike American
    roulette which has 00, and therefore the former has a greater advantage for
    the player compared to its American counterpart.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, bets on the 1x2Gaming European 3D Roulette have a minimum of 1 and
    a maximum of 200 per chip.

<h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">
    This is a game that stands out for innovating in prize payment compared to
    any traditional roulette with the already mentioned return of half of our
    bet.
</h3>
<p>
    Payments are then effectively as expected in all European roulettes. But
    let's analyze them for those approaching the game for the first time:
</p>
<p>
    The game can be divided into two categories of bets: inside bets and outside
    bets.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Inside Bets</strong>: These are the bets we will make within the
        numerical part of the table (0-36), which can be a single bet with a
        payout of 35 to 1 (35 times the bet), split with a payout of 17 to 1,
        street with a payout of 11 to 1, corner with a payout of 8 to 1, and
        line with a minimum payout of 5 to 1.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Outside Bets</strong>: These are the types of bets that we can
        set in adjacent sections of the table and include Dozen and Column with
        payouts of 2 to 1. Odd or Even, High Number (19 to 36), Low Number (1 to
        18), red or black with payouts of 1 to 1. When the result of a round is
        zero (0), half of the bet is returned, excluding 1 to 1 bets, and this
        is what can make the difference from the RTP comment above.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This summarizes the functions that are traditional for any type of roulette
    and ultimately, it is the stability that we expect when approaching any
    table game, be it
    <a href="/en/jogos/roleta/">roulette</a>,
    <a href="/en/jogos/blackjack-br/">blackjack</a>, or
    <a href="/en/jogos/baccarat-br/">online baccarat</a>.

<h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle">
    1x2Gaming, the creative company behind this web roulette, manages to
    surprise us with two innovations that include a rotating screen with super
    realistic 3D animations, specially designed for full screen.
</h3>
<p>
    As we say in all roulette game reviews and table games in general, the
    innovation capacity of creators is particularly limited because ultimately,
    we are dealing with traditional games, with hundreds of years, with fixed
    rules that determine from the beginning the maximum values and possible
    prizes. Even if
    <a href="/en/supplier/1x2-gaming-en/">1x2Gaming</a>
    strives and manages to innovate effectively, even in the prize section. But
    not only that, because this European Roulette is also a 3D game, something
    that is not evident on the initial screen where we will create our bet, but
    rather once we take a spin.
</p>
<p>
    For a game from the year 2017, also correctly translated into Portuguese,
    where a croupier manages to immerse us in the game by telling us the results
    of our bets, which impresses with 3D animations configurable in each of our
    rounds, it is a game worthy of belonging, undoubtedly, to the recommended
    category.<br />Two innovations in a roulette game are not something you see
    every day, and 1Ã—2 is successful.
</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />
<p>
    Of course, there are numerous casinos where we can play roulette on the web,
    and there is Betizen, of course ðŸ™‚ as a demonstration site and with a fair
    review of the game.<br />On the other hand, with real money, you will be
    able to play <strong>1x2Gaming European 3D Roulette</strong> on sites like
    <a href="/en/cassino/analise-betwinner-cassino/">Betwinner</a>,
    <a href="/en/cassino/analise-vera-john/">Vera&amp;John</a>, or in the
    <a href="/en/cassino/analise-20bet-cassino/">20Bet Review</a>, just to name
    a few of those that make up the extensive list in our catalog.<br />Always
    remember to prioritize sites highlighted as "Fair."
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, if it is the first time you register at one of the mentioned
    casinos, we recommend that you check the bonus section where you will find
    the
    <a href="/en/promotions/">welcome promotions</a>
    of each one, along with their respective terms and conditions.<br />On the
    other hand, if you have already tried some of these casinos and want to
    share your experience, we invite you to do so on the free registration
    screen to help strengthen the community. And remember, your vote has a
    direct impact on what other users of the site will see or not see.
