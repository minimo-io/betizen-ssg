<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Video Bingo?</h2>
<p>Video bingo is a perfect fusion of classic bingo and modern slot machines. Unlike traditional bingo, where players manually mark their cards, in video bingo, the game unfolds automatically on a digital screen. Instead of physical balls, randomly generated numbers are used by a computerized system.</p>
<p>The dynamics of video bingo are simple: players acquire virtual cards and then select the number of cards they want to play in each game. Once the game starts, the system announces random numbers, and if these numbers match those on your cards, they are automatically marked. The goal is to complete specific patterns on your cards to win prizes.</p>
