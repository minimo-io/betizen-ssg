<p>According to Netent, there are several reasons to play the Jack and the Beanstalk slot machine, with the variety of features being the main reason this slot has become a popular classic worldwide. These features include walking wilds, re-spins, free spins, win presentations, and a bonus game called Treasure Collection. At the same time, it is an enjoyable game that immerses us in a story, namely the classic English folk tale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_and_the_Beanstalk">Jack and the Beanstalk</a>.</p>
<p>Starting with the most important, in the Jack slot, at least 3 Scatter symbols represented by a chest with a gem will allow us to access the free spins. We will need at least 3 of them to get 10 free spins. An interesting feature is that these symbols remain active during these special spins, so each time we get 3 or more of them, 5 more free spins will be added to our round.</p>
<p>The other interesting feature of this extremely popular slot is its walking wilds. When these appear, we will be awarded a re-spin, that is, a single free spin during which the wild "walks" one reel to the left, remaining active and increasing our chances of getting winning combinations.</p>
<p>These free re-spins will continue to be awarded as long as the wilds participate in winning combinations. As if that were not enough, all prizes obtained with these symbols involved will be paid with a 3x multiplier, and they will appear both in the regular game and during free spins.</p>
<p>As we review its features, we better understand why the Jack and the Beanstalk slot has become a slot present in many of the most popular game sections of most <a href="/en/online-casinos/">online casinos</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to talk about the Treasure Collection, another interesting feature to multiply our winnings in Jack. We will activate it through the key symbols. These can appear during free spins and only on reel number 5. It sounds difficult, but once we get it, we will unlock 3 different functions:</p>
<ul><li>2 money bags collected, which will turn our wilds into stacked wilds. To do this, we will need to get 3 key symbols.</li><li>3 golden hens collected. The same as the previous one but with larger stacked wilds, requiring 6 keys.</li><li>Finally, with 9 of these symbols, we will activate the "Expanding Golden Harps" feature, in this case, the wild will occupy the entire height of the reel and change to give us more chances to win.</li></ul>
<p>It should also be noted that all these variants of the Treasure Collection can activate re-spins, making it the feature that, when activated, allows the highest winnings in the slot machine.</p>
<h2 id="tematica" class="contentIndexTitle mb-1">Theme and Design&nbsp;<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill font-weight-bold">âˆ¼ Medium</span></h2><h3 class="contentIndexSubTitle"></h3>
<p>The theme of this slot is the popular English folk tale Jack and the Beanstalk, set on a farm where we will accompany Jack on the adventure of trying to obtain high prizes in a high volatility slot machine.</p>
<p>The graphics are very attractive for a slot released in 2011, and although the Jack and the Beanstalk slot owes its enormous popularity not to its graphics but to its interesting features, the design is equally pleasant along with its sound environment among birds, just like other slot machines such as Butterfly Staxx 2 or Jungle Giants, keeping us calmly attentive, expecting the features that activate with excellent frequency to increase our chances of obtaining the promised prizes.</p>
<p>In summary, a popular slot machine, with a good RTP and high volatility, with features that make it a favorite around the world.</p>
