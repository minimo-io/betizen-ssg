title: "Gonzo&#8217;s Quest"
description: "Gonzo's Quest is a slot machine whose main theme is the search carried out by the character Gonzo of Eldorado (that mythical kingdom where the Spanish expected to find abundant gold reserves). Launched in 2011, it became popular for being one of the first games to replace the traditional reels with the now well-known avalanches (the symbols fall on top of the previous ones, generating new combination possibilities). In our opinion, there are better games on the market today, but given its high volatility, the extra symbols that we obtain when winning a line and that generate the possibility of obtaining extra winning lines, its agility, its multipliers that allow us to multiply up to 15 times our awards, and its graphic innovations continue to make it an entertaining game."

<p>Gonzo&#8217;s Quest is a highly popular online slot game that is still widely accepted and present in online casinos, being featured in several promotions. The game&#8217;s volatility is an important factor to consider when choosing it, as it pays out less frequently than other games but tends to offer larger prizes, so players will need to be more patient when betting.</p>
<p>One good method to understand the volatility of a game is to consult with its provider or software creator. In the case of Gonzo&#8217;s Quest, Netent is a reputable provider and its paytable can be reviewed. We will discuss how to choose slot machines based on their volatility depending on your playing style later on.</p>
<p>As a new feature, Netent plans to release a virtual reality version of the Gonzo&#8217;s Quest slot game. This means that if you have VR goggles, you will be able to enjoy playing with Gonzo in an immersive way.</p>
<p>Gonzo&#8217;s Quest has an RTP of 95.97% and a medium/high volatility according to Netent. It has 20 fixed paylines and 3 rows, as well as wild symbols and the Free Falls feature. Instead of spinning reels, this game uses a term related to its theme and innovation. The symbols are not arranged on reels, but instead are stones that fall. Therefore, what would be called free spins in other slots are called &#8220;free falls&#8221; in Gonzo&#8217;s Quest. The game is available in desktop and mobile versions.</p>
<p>If you do not understand some of these terms, there is a glossary available for consultation.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Slot theme</h2>
<p>The game&#8217;s introductory video tells the story of Gonzo. It begins in 1541 off the coast of Peru, where Spanish explorers aboard a galleon are in search of gold. However, Gonzo, the main character based on Inca Empire conqueror Francisco Pizarro, has other plans. He steals the captain&#8217;s map and sets out on his own in search of El Dorado, the mythical lost city where the Spanish hoped to find immense riches in gold.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Game Mechanics </h2>
<p>The bet value is controlled in the same way as in many other Netent machines, using two controls: the coin value and the bet level. Gonzo&#8217;s Quest also has an autoplay feature, where players can select the number of automatic spins to be played, between 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000. In this mode, the animations run considerably faster than in a normal spin. Some players find this enjoyable, while others may find it annoying. It depends on each player.</p>
<p>The biggest innovation of this slot game was to replace the traditional reels with the avalanche function, which causes symbols to fall individually into the rows that were previously reels, generating different combinations and disintegrating when they do so. This also generates the fall of extra symbols that, in turn, can generate several winning combinations and increase the level of the multiplier with the same cost as a spin. Without a doubt, a very interesting innovation that has been replicated over the years by many other slot machines.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prizes, RTP and volatility</h2>
<p>Gonzo&#8217;s Quest is a popular online slot game that has gained a lot of attention due to its unique gameplay features. One of the most notable features is that players cannot choose the number of lines to bet on, which is fixed at 20. However, players can adjust their level of risk and potential rewards using the &#8220;Coin Value&#8221; and &#8220;Bet Level&#8221; controls.</p>
<p>The game has five reels, each containing blocks or symbols, with a total of nine different symbols in the entire game. These symbols include seven normal symbols, one wild symbol, and one Free Fall symbol. If a player lands three Free Fall symbols on one of the 20 lines, they will activate the Free Fall feature, which awards them ten free spins.</p>
<p>One of the key factors that players need to consider when playing Gonzo&#8217;s Quest is the game&#8217;s volatility. Volatility refers to the risk associated with a slot game and how often a player can expect to win. In Gonzo&#8217;s Quest, the volatility is relatively high, meaning that players can expect to experience long periods of play without winning, followed by occasional large payouts.</p>
<p>The game&#8217;s RTP (Return to Player) is around 96%, which is a relatively high percentage compared to other online slot games. This means that over time, players can expect to receive back 96% of the money they have wagered on the game.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Gonzo&#8217;s Quest is a thrilling and exciting online slot game that offers players the chance to win big. However, players need to be aware of the game&#8217;s high volatility and adjust their level of risk accordingly. With a high RTP and the potential to win free spins, Gonzo&#8217;s Quest is a must-try for any avid slot game fan.</p>
