<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prizes, RTP and volatility</h2>
<p>When we play Book of Ra slot we have to know that we are dealing with a classic 5&#215;3 reels with 9 configurable pay lines. A game that has been copied over and over again and has been a great influence in the <a href="/online-casinos/">online casinos</a> industry.<br>But this popularity has a reason, since Book of Ra not only continues to be the Egyptian slot of choice for many players, but also surpasses its own sequel, or improved version, as Book of Ra Deluxe tried to be. Because?<br>Prizes and functions. It is that the Book of Ra slot machine, despite having an RTP of only 92.13% (well below the industry average of around 96%), has a maximum prize per spin that allows us to multiply our bet x5000.<br>Let&#8217;s review the maximum payouts per symbol to get a clearer idea of what we are talking about and one of the reasons for its popularity.</p>
<ul><li>The explorer: Pays 5,000x the stake for 5 symbols on a win line.</li><li>Pharaoh: Pays 2,000x times for 5 symbols.</li><li>Horus: Pays 750x times for 5 symbols.</li><li>Golden Beetle: Pays 750x times the bet for 5 symbols.</li><li>Normal cards: They pay between 150x and 100x times the stake.</li><li>Book of Ra Scatter/Wild Card: Pays 1,800x times the stake for 5 symbols on a win line.<br>Let&#8217;s look at an example of what our paytable looks like for the maximum bet in the Book of Ra slot machine.</li></ul>
<p>The maximum bet in The Book of RÃ¡ is 1800 coins and the minimum bet is only 1 coin per line. The value of the coin is configurable in values ranging from 0.5 to 10.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Functions and mechanics</h2>
<p>Like any classic game, the Book of Ra slot machine has only 2 special functions, but they contribute to making our bets easy to understand, while its dynamics keep us focused.<br>These special features are the ability to double or lose the prizes of our winning spins and the free spins that are triggered by the Scatter symbol that does double duty as Wild or Wild.<br>We are going to need at least 3 Scatter/Wild symbols to get 10 free spins.<br>During the beginning of these spins 1 random expanding symbol will be selected. Once we&#8217;ve received regular spin wins, this special symbol will expand to cover all 3 positions on the reel and will pay like a regular symbol on all paylines and non-adjacent positions.<br>These expanding symbols are only activated during winning spins.<br>Additionally, during the regular game we will have the option to collect our prizes or enter the mini game that allows us to double them. This Book of Ra feature was copied (among many others) by the Book of Dead slot and hence our comment on how this game has been a huge influence on the entire iGaming industry.<br>During this mini game, the Book of Ra slot opens a card game for us with a maximum of 6 rounds, in which we must bet on the red or black color of the card to come out.<br>Undoubtedly another reason for its popularity, since in a simple way the game allows us to unlimitedly double our prizes, and with a risk that goes to our choice!</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theme and design</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked a lot about how the Ancient Egyptian theme has been popular in the world of slots since its inception. This is attested by classics such as the Book of Ra slot machine itself, such as classics in the style of Cleopatra or Pharaoh&#8217;s Fortune, even the most modern replicas of Book of Ra such as the aforementioned Book of Dead from Play&#8217;n Go.<br>Like all classic Book of Ra, it has a design that for many players has already become outdated, even more so if we compare it with the visual possibilities of modern slot machines. For an example of this, we only need to see games like the recent Monster Pop from Betsoft.<br>However, Book of Ra remains current thanks to its simplicity, which combined with a juicy prize table leaves it as an option that will continue to accompany us. Especially to those who are looking for interesting earning possibilities in a very well balanced game that stands the test of time and continues to influence new developers.</p>
