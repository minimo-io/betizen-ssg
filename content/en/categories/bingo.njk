<p>
    Video bingo games are one of the most sought-after options on online casino
    platforms, which has led to the development of various entertaining
    variations of this game by well-known providers, garnering more followers.
</p>
<p>
    Traditional bingo is simple and lucrative, creating interactive group
    entertainment that also gives us the opportunity to win. Bingo is one of the
    most entertaining and oldest forms of gambling, which can bring together
    players of all ages and backgrounds. The objective is to complete one or
    more game cards, which contain a certain number of randomly selected
    numbers. The first player or players to complete their cards will be the
    winners of the prize or prizes. Before continuing, we must consider some
    terms of the game, such as the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Bingo:</strong> the name of the game used by the player to
        announce that they have completed their card.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Card or Ticket</strong>: used to mark the numbers that will be
        randomly drawn from the drum. The card contains a certain number of
        random numbers under the letters B, I, N, G, O.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Balls:</strong> contain one of the letters B, I, N, G, O and a
        number below each of these, and will be used by the caller to announce
        the chosen number, then placed on the game board for players to verify.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Control Panel:</strong> where all the numbers drawn from the
        drum or container will appear.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Drum or container:</strong> where all the balls are placed and
        mixed, which will be drawn one by one at random until a winner or
        winners are determined.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Winning patterns or lines:</strong> these are the required forms
        to win the game. The most well-known is BINGO or full card, but we may
        find patterns such as horizontal lines, vertical lines, circles, among
        others, which determine additional prizes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Jackpot:</strong> in some video bingo games, we may find a
        number of cumulative jackpots, which increase every time we play because
        a percentage of our bet is allocated to the jackpot, which we will
        access upon obtaining a certain pattern.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The numbers will be obtained from the drum or container where the balls are
    located (the number of balls varies depending on the bingo variation), which
    contain a letter and a number. These balls or numbers will be announced by a
    caller and will be marked on a visible panel so that players can verify the
    numbers with their cards in hand. Before starting the game, the winning
    patterns of the game will be announced, as well as the prizes to be
    distributed, and even, depending on the game variation, an accumulated prize
    may be offered for completing the cards with a certain number of balls
    drawn. We must take into account that players can participate in the game by
    acquiring more than one card and that prizes could be shared among more than
    one winner.
</p>
<p>
    Now that we have knowledge of the game, we will see that online gambling
    platforms offer both online bingo and video bingo games. Both games are
    based on the traditional Bingo game, but they also include their own
    features and some differences. While Online Bingo follows the same dynamics
    of in-person bingo, including the group game mechanism as well as the
    inclusion of a game moderator, video bingo is a single-player game, in which
    we can access additional balls that we can acquire for a set bet.
</p>
<p>
    Video bingos are therefore bingo games adapted to be primarily for a single
    player, which give us the experience of playing a bingo slot machine,
    providing various game themes, more payment patterns, more entertaining
    video and sound effects, and additional mini-games or bonuses that add more
    excitement, as well as the opportunity to acquire additional balls if we are
    very close to obtaining a winning pattern.
</p>
<h2><b>How to Play Video Bingo</b></h2>
<p>
    To start the game, similar to slot machines, we must have balance in our
    bankroll and then choose how many cards we will play, depending on the game
    variation and the provider it could range from 4 to 12 cards per game which
    we can change as many times as we want before starting. After deciding our
    bet and the chosen quantity of cards we will play, we will proceed to select
    the Play option to start the round. Bets may vary depending on the game,
    considering that we will bet for each card we want to play. For example, if
    we want to play 4 cards per play and the minimum bet is USD$ 0.25, we will
    be betting USD$ 1 per game.
</p>
<p>
    The start of the game will give us the first balls in a random way (the
    number of balls varies depending on the type of game) which will be
    automatically marked on our game cards, saving us the trouble of marking
    them, and will pay us if we have obtained any of the patterns that are
    normally found on the starting screen as information. Winning patterns may
    vary depending on the type of game and may contain from 6 to 20 combinations
    that include horizontal lines, vertical lines, letter shapes, among others.
    We may also find patterns with which we can access accumulated jackpots,
    mini-games, or bonus rounds that make the game more exciting.
</p>
<p>
    Another feature that we can take advantage of is that we will have the
    opportunity to receive additional balls, which we will use if we have come
    very close to obtaining a winning pattern. This option will give us more
    opportunities to obtain greater winnings, but we must take into account that
    each additional ball has an additional cost and that, depending on the type
    of video bingo we are playing, there is a limit on the number of additional
    balls per game.
</p>
<p>
    Like all video slots, video bingo games have RTP, volatility, and a
    frequency of winning which we must take into account before starting to
    play. Many providers offer this information with a range of differences due
    to the influence of the number of cards to play, the number of additional
    balls taken, patterns, and additional bonuses available, among other
    factors.
</p>
<p>
    The main benefits of video bingo games that we could mention are that we can
    play them at any time from the comfort of our homes or from anywhere on our
    mobile devices. Additionally, the games are more exciting due to their
    mini-games and various patterns, they are fast, and we won't have to worry
    about missed numbers as they will be marked automatically. On the other
    hand, it does not offer the group entertainment feature for which the game
    is well known, and some users may feel that the game is too fast-paced, and
    even the sensation of higher bets is felt when using the option of
    additional balls.
</p>
<h2><b>Video Bingo Variations</b></h2>
<p>
    Video bingo variations are based on traditional bingo games, with additional
    features that vary depending on the providers, who develop games with a
    certain number of balls, number of numbers on the cards, number of
    additional balls allowed to be purchased, and number of patterns that exist.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Video Bingo with 90 numbers (balls)</b>, games like Candy Bingo 3D by
        Salsa Technology which will give us up to 34 initial balls, with up to 4
        cards of 15 numbers to play and 6 game patterns. The number of balls
        given may vary depending on the provider as well as the number of
        additional balls we can buy, as is the case with Pachinko 3D from the
        same provider, which will give us 44 balls initially and we can choose
        cards of up to 25 numbers. Normally this variation of video bingo can
        offer alternative bonus games that can add excitement to the game.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Video Bingo with 80 numbers (balls)</b>, in this version we usually
        find cards with a total of 16 numbers divided into 4 lines and 4
        columns. The number of winning patterns varies depending on the game or
        developer as well as the initial number of balls given and the
        additional mini-games that can be found.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Video Bingo with 75 numbers (balls)</b>, where we will find a total
        of 25 numbers (24 numbers + 1 FREE or free number) distributed on a card
        with 5 lines and 5 columns. Like in all video bingo variations, the
        number of patterns, payouts, additional balls allowed, etc. vary
        depending on the game provider.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Video Bingo with 30 numbers (balls)</b>, also known as Speed Bingo,
        is a very fast and simple version of video bingo that has become one of
        the most popular. This variation offers us cards with 3 rows and 3
        columns, giving us a total of 9 possible numbers, with the only winning
        play being BINGO or a full card, with no additional patterns or
        mini-games.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Common Video Bingo Game Strategies</b></h2>
<p>
    Like in slot machines, before betting on new games, we should try the free
    versions that many providers offer, this way we can familiarize ourselves
    with the game mechanics and get an idea of how much we will bet per game.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We will choose to play simpler video bingos at the beginning, with fewer
        numbers and the least amount of cards per play until we can understand
        the winning patterns as well as the bets.
    </li>
    <li>
        Video bingos are gaming options where we can take better advantage of
        the bonuses that casinos offer us for our deposits, as these games are
        fast and the rollovers required to obtain our winnings can be achieved
        more quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
        The initial bet amount should be modest, in case we want to play more
        than 2 cards, aiming to start with the minimum bet and maximize our
        winnings once we have obtained a profit margin. One of the mistakes we
        could make is to play high bets from the beginning with more than 4
        cards per game, exposing our bankroll to a rapid loss.
    </li>
    <li>
        The option to purchase additional balls is an option that can give us
        greater winnings, only if we are close to obtaining a worthwhile winning
        pattern considering the bet/winning ratio. In short, let's avoid buying
        additional balls if the winnings would be lower than the bet.
    </li>
    <li>
        Like any game of chance, we must have money to play that does not
        interfere with our finances, having a defined amount to play which
        should not be exceeded. Playing time and setting achievable goals are
        measures we must practice as they will create a discipline that in the
        long run will help us enjoy gambling games.
    </li>
</ul>
