<p>Big Time Gaming is a slot provider based in Australia, with a rather interesting track record in terms of innovations. While they may not have a huge selection of games compared to other developers with more time in the market, BTG was actually the first to create a game mode that has become increasingly popular, known as Megaways. This is a slot mechanism where our chances of getting a winning combination are not based on a fixed number of lines but on dynamic calculations in relation to the obtained symbols.</p>
<p>Considering that the highly competitive iGaming industry often relies on copying rather than taking the risks of innovation, it is gratifying to have a developer that bets on creating new gaming possibilities for players.</p>
<p>With an ambiance generally within what could be considered as "cartoonish," Big Time Gaming continues to deliver high-quality titles such as the acclaimed and popular Bonanza or <a href="/en/game/slot-monopoly-megaways/">Monopoly Megaways</a>.</p>
