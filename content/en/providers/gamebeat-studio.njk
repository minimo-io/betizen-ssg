<p>We recently added <strong>Neko Games</strong> to the Betizen catalog and we were encouraged to incorporate it among other featured providers such as NoLimit City or Salsa Technology for the creation of one of the most interesting online bingo video games that have been launched in recent times as is the Thunderstruck 2 video bingo. And today it&#8217;s time to proudly announce that we are adding to our catalog <strong>Gamebeat Studio free slot games</strong>.</p>
<p>Why do we say proudly? There are several reasons for this, as always at Betizen we are mainly concerned with two of them.</p>
<p>First and foremost, for the quality of their slots. Just seeing their latest releases such as Odin&#8217;s Tree dedicated to the world of Viking runes or Max Miner will make this clear. We are in front of a great slot creator.</p>
<p>Secondly, the transparency that a studio like Gamebeat offers to players from  first contact, something in which, in theory most (in theory) relevant providers such as Blueprint itself, (which recently launched the D1os Maradona slot prior to the Qatar soccer world cup),  could look for inspiration.<br>
In this sense, GameBeat offers us all the technical data such as RTP, functionality and volatility.</p>
<p>Reviewing additional data a bit, it is interesting to note that, like Neko Games, Gamebeat is a studio was launched at the end of 2021 and that it has been really operational for the first time in 2022. It&#8217;s games are developed to support all currencies, translated into 17 languages ​​and available all around the world, which means that Gamebeat games are in many casinos many operating within Spain, Latin America and other emerging markets.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this review, some of these casinos where Gamebeat is present are: Glory Casino, Playamo casinos such as 20Bet, BitStarz, mBit (the latter both Bitcoin and crypto casinos), as well as others such as PinUp or NeoSpin, not to mention that their slots are distributed by giants like Softswiss.</p>
<p>Welcome then another prominent casino content provider and creator to Betizen.org</p>
