<p>For more than 20 years, Netent, a Swedish-based company, has remained one of the pioneering providers in the online entertainment industry. It is one of the most reputable game creators in the casino industry, serving as a reference for both online casino operators and players alike. Their catalog boasts around 200 slot machines of all types, but they consistently stay ahead of the curve with games that are of excellent graphical quality, innovative, and transparent. This is especially important for us at Betizen, and we highlight the ease with which players can access basic information about a Netent slot, such as its RTP or volatility. Both values determine the appropriateness of different playing strategies and apply to different types of players.</p>
<p>Some of Netent&#8217;s slot machines have also marked a before and after with game features and mechanics that have since become a standard replicated in countless slots from other providers. For example, the Avalanche feature introduced in the game Gonzo&#8217;s Quest, which was later improved with the sequel, Gonzo&#8217;s Quest Megaways.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some of Netent&#8217;s slot machines belong to the company&#8217;s progressive jackpot network. This means that players from all casinos benefit from the possibility of winning a jackpot that has been accumulating across the entire network and which often reaches extraordinary values.</p>
<p>Netent is a company listed on the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm stock exchange.</p>
