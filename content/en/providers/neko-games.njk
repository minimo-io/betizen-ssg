<p>The mission of Neko Games is to create casino games for emerging markets with the intention of converting the active mass of lifelong players into experienced gamblers in the online world, maximizing their value as players as well as for the <a href="/en/online-casinos/">online casinos</a> where they develop their business.</p>
<p>Nako is a brand focused on video-bingos. Why does Neko Games specialize in this type of online bingo?</p>
<p>Because the mechanics of electronic bingo or video bingo games are easy to understand. On the other hand, bingo in general is a better socially accepted game than its counterparts such as <a href="/en/games/free-slots/">online slot machines</a>, and finally Neko has dedicated itself since its foundation to providing high-impact and popular games, converted to the video-bingo mechanics.</p>
<p>Among these games are the bingo versions of classics like Immortal Romance or recently the Thunderstruck 2 slot.</p>
<p>Neko Games was founded by Velo Partners, a UK venture capital firm. The ideal partner to build a cutting-edge game studio. Additionally, Neko Games is part of a network of studios with a worldwide presence, which makes it possible for their games to be present in the most reliable casinos on the Internet.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular video bingo from Neko Games are: Immortal Romance, Pachinko and the new release Thunderstruck 2 video bingo.</p>
