<p>When we talk about IGT or International Gaming Technology, we are talking about one of the giants in the entertainment industry. So much so, that if you have ever entered a physical casino, you have likely seen some of their slot machines. IGT is, in essence, the largest manufacturer of slot machine cabinets in the world, with annual revenues of around US$4.69 billion in 2015. Based in Nevada, United States, but with offices in London, Rome, Providence, Rhode Island, and Las Vegas, IGT has stood out in the world of land-based casinos, as we have said, but has been forced to re-launch many of its slot machines in the online casino market.</p>
<p>That is why IGT is one of those providers from which we can expect those classic slot machines of a lifetime, such as the Cleopatra slot machine, rather than those modern and innovative slot machines that we find in providers whose main market is the internet. Still, IGT&#8217;s offering is competitive and has its audience, with games related to successful franchises such as Monopoly or Star Trek, or slots associated with blockbuster films such as Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s, Hangover, Ghostbusters, Sex and the City, Indiana Jones, and Godzilla.</p>
