<p>If we were recently talking about Betsoft and saying that it is one of the most popular slot providers, with 14 years of experience in 2020, then we can say without a doubt that Microgaming is THE most recognized casino solutions provider in the industry and one of the longest-standing as well.</p>
<p>So much so that Microgaming&#8217;s origins can be traced back to 1994 when the brand launched Gaming Club, its first online casino, and in 2004 its first casino software for mobile devices. A milestone in the entertainment and gambling industry if we consider that the mobile ecosystem was still in its infancy.</p>
<p>Their products include casino games and slots, poker, bingo, sports betting, land-based casinos, and live dealers. Some of the brand&#8217;s most famous slots are the eternal Thunderstruck II or Immortal Romance, games that already belong to the category of classics and the most played on the Internet.</p>
<p>As if that weren&#8217;t enough, Microgaming holds the Guinness Record for having paid the largest jackpot in history paid by a slot machine&#8221; by paying a prize of â‚¬17,879,645.12 to a player at Betway. Additionally, Microgaming is one of the co-founders of eCOGRA (e-Commerce Online Gaming Regulation and Assurance), an organization focused on ensuring transparency in the industry.</p>
