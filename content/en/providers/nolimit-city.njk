<p>Nolimit City is a developer and provider of a slot catalog for the <a href="/en/online-casinos/">online casino</a> industry. It was founded in 2014 by Jonas Tegman and Emil Svärd, and has offices in Malta, India, and Stockholm. These two entrepreneurs bring significant experience in the iGaming world — both previously worked as slot developers at industry giant NetEnt and were founding partners of the ComeOn! casino.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this review (2020), <strong>Nolimit City</strong> was preparing to launch its 26th slot: Punk Rocker. However, the game that truly allowed Nolimit City to stand out from the crowd in terms of online entertainment and betting was Tombstone — itself inspired by another high-volatility, high-payout title from the brand called Hot Nudge.</p>

<p>Moreover, Nolimit City decided to compete fiercely in the realm of game mechanics, developing features like xWays® — a popular and innovative gameplay mechanic originally inspired by Big Time Gaming’s — as well as xNudge®, both of which, while not invented by Nolimit City, give the brand’s games a uniquely compelling potential for winning combinations.</p>

<p>But make no mistake: in the online gaming industry, many providers simply churn out clones of successful features and slots. That is NOT the case with <strong>Nolimit City</strong>. Instead, we’re dealing with a slot provider that constantly seeks to innovate upon what already exists.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the recent launch of the Nolimit-Replay feature, announced in April 2020, which allows players and operators to instantly replay winning spins and big moments from other successful players — an interesting and innovative addition for both operators and players alike.</p>
