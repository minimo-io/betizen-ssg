<p>According to themselves, Novomatic is the number 1 gaming technology company in Europe and one of the number 1 in the world, with 5.1 billion dollars in sales in 2019. And it is that we are effectively facing one of the industry giants of casinos.<br>
Headquartered in Austria, 30,000 employees around the world, offices in 50 countries, and approximately 2,100 gaming halls, it is very likely that, just like any other long-established provider, if you have ever entered a casino or gaming site, betting, it is likely that you have seen a slot machine or electronic game from Novomatic.</p>
<p>Since 2011 this land-based casino giant began to make the transition to the online world, with the acquisition of Greentube Internet Entertainment Solutions.</p>
<p>This combination of highly popular games that have been proven effective over time, such as the Book of Ra slot machine itself, together with the experience in the online sector provided by its acquisitions have allowed Novomatic to continue to be relevant, supported by classics. which despite being copied countless times (often with great success) continue to have a strong fan base.</p>
<p>That being said, to newer players, accustomed to providers who are challenging the possibilities of technology trying to offer ever more dynamic, visually appealing and entertaining games, Novomatic slots and games may seem a bit dated.</p>
<p>In short, a voluminous catalog of classic games, which are sustained despite the passage of time, sometimes helped with Deluxe versions, sometimes in their original versions. A heavyweight that we should definitely experience.</p>
