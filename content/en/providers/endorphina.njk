<p>Despite having only been founded in 2014, especially if we compare with the fact that the first slot providers began their online activity in the &#8217;90s. Yet Endorphina, based in Prague, Czech Republic, has proven that it has something to say about online gaming.<br>
And it says it through its entertainment offering, particularly through its slots, some of which involve themes that can be controversial. As an example, we have the Taboo or Twerk slots, both within the category of adult-themed slots. Or Satoshi&#8217;s Secret itself dedicated to the anonymous creator of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>With a risky spirit, Endorphina undoubtedly brings a positive and quality air to an area that sometimes finds it difficult to get away from diamonds and fruits.</p>
