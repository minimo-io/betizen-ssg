<p>
    But what is a slot provider? In the world of online casinos, companies that
    develop slot games, video bingo, poker, among others, are called providers.
    They (usually) do not offer a casino platform. Instead, they sell their
    services and their catalog of games to online casinos, which in turn offer
    them to their players.
</p>
<p>
    In exchange, game and slot machine providers usually receive a commission,
    that is, a portion of the profits from those casinos with which they have
    commercial agreements and offer their games. Obviously, there are different
    modalities and commercial agreements in this regard.
</p>
<p>
    There are or have been more than 300 game providers in the industry. Some of
    them have a long and good reputation, such as IGT, Netent or Microgaming,
    and others are directly or indirectly involved in different types of fraud.
    And thatâ€™s where the importance of choosing your games well comes in, and to
    achieve this, a key piece is knowing how to choose a good provider.
</p>
<p>
    Like in any industry, slot providers, as we also call them in Betizen,
    compete with each other, launching new games on the market every year and
    promoting them at specific iGaming fairs and events. They also have specific
    promotions in different sponsor casinos.
</p>
<p>
    Many of the slots developed by these creators have free versions, as you can
    find here, others only offer their versions when we play with real money. At
    Betizen, we cover and offer reviews of both types of slot machines, so you
    can have a better idea of your possibilities when it comes to betting.
