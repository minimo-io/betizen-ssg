                <h2 id="affiliate-faq"><strong>What is Affiliate Marketing?</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Affiliate Marketing</strong> is part of what is known as “Performance Marketing,” and it plays an important role in the iGaming industry as well as other industries, such as retail through programs like <em>Amazon Associates</em>.
                </p>
                <p>

                    <a href="{{ '/casinos/' | locale_url }}">online casinos</a>, it is a way for operators to gain new players without directly investing in their acquisition, offering their partners or affiliates a share of the profits for performing this task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As in any industry, there are good and bad actors. Those who operate legitimately and those who hide information, with deceptive practices and Terms and Conditions for both affiliates and players, with hidden fees, affiliate managers who occupy their positions for a short time, brands that disappear or stop paying, and affiliates themselves who generate spam and misleading advertising. And also programs that try to do their work in a fair, transparent, and sustainable manner.
