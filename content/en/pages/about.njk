                    The era of fraudulent casino and affiliate sites is over.
                    <br />
                    The online betting market has changed.
                  </p>

                  <p>Have you ever visited sites full of ads? Ok, that is NOT Betizen.</p>

                  <p>Affiliates who promoted unregulated sites have now obtained licenses and fiercely defend regulated gaming‚Äîor they work for the industry.
                  
                  Meanwhile, casino, forex, and binary sites continue entering regulated markets <a class="italic" href="#">not always with approved licenses</a>, confusing players, users, the general public, and regulators.</p>

                  <p>We believe that the best possible solution comes from the market itself. Directly from the experiences of <i>players</i>, for <i>players</i>.</p>


                  <p>üåü It is from this place that Betizen (re)emerged with the mission to offer just one thing: <span class="font-black">reliable & auditable listings and rankings</span> for players, operators, and managers.</p>

                  How do we get trustworthy listings?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content prose md:prose-lg prose-p:my-[10px] min-w-full">
                  <p><span class="font-bold"></span> Listings on Betizen depend on collective experience. On the (auditable) votes of participants.
                  <br />
                  <span class="italic">(Our v2 even foresees blockchain technology to bring transparency to vote auditing).</span>
                                    
                  </p>

                  <p>Usually affiliate sites showcase brands and operators for the best price. Betizen is not na√Øve‚Äîwe are affiliates indeed. But we reserve spaces for sponsors, and in doing so we purify our listings, which depend exclusively on "<strong>karma</strong>".</p>

                  <p>This way, we fight real fraud <strong>by including all sites</strong> in the possibility of being listed and <strong>earning their place</strong> through good operational practices. And being judged by the public.</p>

                  <p>Sites with valid licenses will be properly marked in green.</p>

                  <p>
                      <strong>What is karma?</strong> Karma is what drives Betizen (and life!).
                      <br />
                      Earn karma by interacting with the site and other users, and distribute karma through your votes, thus altering the site listings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Why merit?</strong> Only users who have earned karma by interacting and benefiting the community will be able to vote, <u>transfer karma</u>, and alter the rankings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Why proof-of-work?</strong> Proof-of-work (a concept from the Bitcoin world) means that only those who contribute their effort to improve the community will be able to earn karma, vote, and influence the direction of the community.

                  <p>Absolutely, our foundation is built on earning and honoring users' trust. There are paid and unpaid reviews. The paid ones are marked accordingly.
