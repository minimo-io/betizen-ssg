              There are (too) many
              <a href="{{ '/casinos/' | locale_url }}">online casinos</a>, too
              much regulation (of the shi***y kind). That you might feel lost.
              So... here we are. Betizen, cutting through the BS in online
              betting, but still being zen about it ðŸ¤£.
            </p>
            <p>
              So to clear things out, (and avoid getting lost in the glitz):
            </p>
            <p>
              What is a good casino for us? Well, it's not that hard, just one
              that is transparent about what is offering, the conditions for
              withdrawing, and that well... PAYS when it has to! One that let's
              you limit your gambling and earn a buck.
            </p>
            <p>
              What is a good affiliate program? Also simple, one that is not
              tricky about admin fees, that pay what the program promises, one
              with a responsive affiliate manager and that has a good system
              (with API).
            </p>
            <p>
              What is a good game studio / provider? One that creates great,
              fair audited games that are fun to bet on!
            </p>

            <p>Don't be fooled by flashy facades.</p>
